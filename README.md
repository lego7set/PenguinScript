# PenguinScript
PenguinScript, a PenguinMod extension that I created.

It was all made possible by this [tutorial](https://github.com/tlaceby/guide-to-interpreters-series) that I adapted into a transpiler (also thank you @GarboMuffin for building the TurboWarp compiler which I basically stole for this)

Uses complex.js to handle complex numbers.
